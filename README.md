## About the project

The logos are adjusted to work on a dark background. Some of them are not suitable for light backgrounds. Since the Git interface is white you might think the logo is not loading but it is, just right-click on the logo and select copy image address and use that URL for the logo.

## I will regularly add new channel logos, you can also message me and request logos

* The goal of this project is to give people better access to logos in good quality and to meet the design requirements of the designers/owners of the logos and supply the increasing demand for better quality experience.

* All the logos come in PNG format and work perfectly on dark backgrounds. At some point in the future I plan to upload logos in SVG. This is not high priority right now. 

* US local networks that can be hard to find we also provide.

* If you are looking for a hard to find logo for a specific country/network of your choice I can try to have one of the logo artists that I work with create one for you for a donation to them. 

* The list is free for personal use. Please reference my work for any re-distribution. It's forbidden to sell the logos to 3rd party or use them in any illegitimate way. I do not take responsibility for what you do with the logos.

* I do not own the logos. All the logos in the project do not have copyright on them but instead they are trademarked and with Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses. PM me if you wish to remove/change a logo you own or submit your own logo.

* You can link directly to the RAW URL of any logo but I do not take any responsibility if links are broken. If you are having issues with the logos url's then contact me.

* If a channel changes its logo or rebrands, I will replace the original logo, if you are using direct link then the logo will update for you automatically. It can take some time for some devices/software to update the logo, you might need to restart/clear cache.

* If you would like to be able to link the logos to a service you provide, for example a website/service/app then please contact me first.

## Naming convention

Filenames are all lowercase and start with channel name and then number if applicable and country code at the end. Dashes are used to replace spaces. Call signs for local networks are also lowercase and appear before country.

Examples: `abc-7-koat-us.png` | `discovery-channel-us.png` | `syfy-br.png` | `fox-crime-it.png` | `kanal-5-se.png`

Time delay channels are identified with `plus`, example: `challenge-plus-uk.png` For Australia the +2 channels are `fox-hits-plus-2-au.png`

If ampersand (`&`) is present in channel name then it will be replaced with `and`, example: `a-and-e-us.png`

For channels that don't authenticate with a network affiliate or Owned-and-operated station then I will use the call sign and/or city/region.

Example: `7-news-miami-wsvn-us.png` | `7-news-boston-whdh-us.png`

Be aware of the dash when searching for a logo in a long list of channels, include it in your search. You can also write your search string without the dashes and spaces, it might give better results

Example: `channel-4` instead of `channel 4`, or just `channel4`

A horizontal version of a logo will have `hz` in its name if there's a regular version also. Example: `bbc-world-news-hz-uk.png`
